We store only very limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment processor, [Payment Processor Name], and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.
                        
                                Use of your Information

                                We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:
                        
                                By Law or to Protect Rights: If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

                                Sale or Bankruptcy: If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.
                        
                                We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.
